I can't upload the video directly because it's too large apparently. You can't view it if downloaded anyways since it's from my phone or something according to my computer. Hence, please use this google drive link to view.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r4vhP6NdSceTCbO1lFfearmDvhfYmdrX/view?usp=drive_link

Warning: You might have to use the link a few times, the first time I tried it it claimed the video couldn't play but after that it worked when I did it a second time.
Again, apologies for the mess with this, but I literally can't use any other option.
