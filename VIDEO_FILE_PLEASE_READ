I can't upload the video directly because it's too large apparently. You can't view it if downloaded anyways since it's from my phone or something according to my computer. Hence, please use this google drive link to view.

Warning: You might have to use the link a few times, the first time I tried it it claimed the video couldn't play but after that it worked when I did it a second time.
One thing I forgot to mention in the video is there is some background sound, that is NOT from my game, I don't know what it is. Sorry.
Again, apologies for the mess with this, but I literally can't use any other option.
